Backtest engine for [NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io).

The `nautilus-backtest` crate provides a comprehensive event-driven backtesting framework that allows
quantitative traders to test and validate trading strategies on historical data with high
fidelity market simulation. The system replicates real market conditions including:

- Event-driven backtesting engine with simulated exchanges.
- Market data replay with configurable latency and fill models.
- Order matching engines with realistic execution simulation.
- Multi-venue and multi-asset backtesting capabilities.
- Comprehensive configuration and state management.

## Platform

[NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io) is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade
algorithmic trading platform, providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest
portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical data with an event-driven engine,
and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

NautilusTrader's design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting mission-critical, trading system backtesting and live deployment workloads.

## Feature flags

This crate provides feature flags to control source code inclusion during compilation,
depending on the intended use case, i.e. whether to provide Python bindings
for the [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader) Python package,
or as part of a Rust only build.

- `ffi`: Enables the C foreign function interface (FFI) from [cbindgen](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen).
- `python`: Enables Python bindings from [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs).
- `extension-module`: Builds as a Python extension module (used with `python`).
